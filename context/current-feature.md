- Dashboard UI Phase 1 — ShadCN init (radix / Nova preset), `/dashboard` route with
  layout shell, dark mode by default, top bar (search + New Collection / New Item,
  display only), placeholder Sidebar and Main. Build passes; verified in browser.
- Dashboard UI Phase 2 — full sidebar from mock data: Types group (links to
  `/items/TYPE`), Collections group (Favorites + Recent), collapsible sections, user
  avatar/settings footer. Collapsible inline rail on desktop, overlay drawer on mobile
  via `SidebarProvider` context; top bar toggle wired up. Build + lint pass; verified
  in browser (desktop collapse, mobile drawer, link navigation).
